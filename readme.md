Additional Feature:
Support a manual mode, where the user can single-step through the animation (e.g. M to switch to manual,
then SPACE to advance one frame at a time). 
Then Q to quite manual mode, which will turn back to auto 1 frame per second.

Note:
Please don't take marks off for my grid line color to be black.
I have asked the instructor about this
